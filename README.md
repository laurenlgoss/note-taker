## Usage

To invoke the application run this command in the terminal:

node server.js
```

If user is creating the server on their local device, the application will host a server listening to PORT 3001. If accessing the application through Heroku, the PORT may be different.

To access the application in the browser through the user's local device, type ```http://localhost:3001/``` to access the ```index.html```.

The user will then be taken to the ```notes.html``` page in which new notes can be created and saved. All new notes will be saved in the ```db.json``` file.
